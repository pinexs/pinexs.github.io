Every **Erasmus+** project signifies a new adventure, a new learning curve, and a new story. For me, this story is my **second** **Erasmus experience,** one that started in Antalya and found its way to Poggiardo, a town nestled deep in the "heel" of Italy's boot. This time, I have the distinct honor of undertaking this journey as the group leader for a fantastic team. In this blog post, I want to share not just the details of our project, but the unforgettable memories captured between the chaotic beauty of Italy's capital and the quiet, historic streets of the Salento region.

# Part 1: A One-Day Marathon of Chaos and Flavour in Rome

Our adventure officially kicked off when our team, hailing from different corners of Turkey, convened in Istanbul. As our group of five took off from Istanbul.

We were buzzing with anticipation for what lay ahead. Our first stop was not our final destination, but a layover that is a destination in its own right: **Rome.**
We landed in Rome with only one day to spare, and we were determined to make the most ofit. There was just one challenge: we would be exploring the city with all our luggage in tow. Rather than slowing us down, this thrust us into what felt like an advanced "Roman tourist simulation."
And yes, I must confirm the famous stereotype: Italian pizza truly lives up to the hype. It might even exceed it. **I genuinely ate the best pizzas of my life that day in Rome.** The thin crust, the fresh ingredients, and that indescribable flavour made me think, "This is where pizza was perfected."

Even while dragging our suitcases, it was impossible not to be captivated by the city's magic. Rome is, in every sense, an open-air museum that demands to be explored on foot. Every corner reveals thousands of years of history. In our short time, we managed to see:

## Teatro dell’Opera

- Which greeted us with its magnificent architecture.

## The Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi)

- The Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi): An iconic moment, tossing a coin over our shoulder to ensure our return, even amidst the massive crowds.

## The Pantheon

A true architectural marvel that takes your breath away with its massive dome and the famous inscription on its portico reading **"M. AGRIPPA L. F. COS. TERTIVM FECIT."**

## The Colosseum

Even just seeing it from the outside, standing before that colossal structure, it was impossible not to imagine the roar of the gladiators.

One day is nothing for Rome. It was tiring, but also comical, to navigate with luggage. In this city where every tourist seems to be rolling a suitcase over the cobblestones, we left so many streets unwalked, so many historical sites undiscovered...

## Part 2: The Long Journey South to the Serenity of Salento: Poggiardo

After our 24 hour whirlwind tour of Rome, we began the long trek to our true destination. First, we took a long bus journey south to **Lecce,** a city renowned for its Baroque architecture and often called the "Florence of the South." From there, a regional train took us to our project's home base: the small, charming Italian town of Poggiardo.
Upon arrival, we were met by **our organizer, Valeria,**

Whose energy immediately made us feel welcome. She quickly briefed us on the project, our tasks, and my responsibilities as the group leader.

Poggiardo is a historic town in the heart of the Puglia region, located on the Salento peninsula. Unlike the ornate Baroque style of Lecce, it is quieter, more modest, but possesses an equally deep history. This town, built upon ancient Messapian (pre-Roman) settlements, is a place where time seems to flow more slowly, with its narrow streets, stone houses, and small churches appearing at every turn

# Part 3: Italian Hospitality and the Sweetness of Being the “Foreigner”

What made our experience in Poggiardo truly special was, without a doubt, the people. This is a small town where everyone knows each other. As a result, we (likely the only group of foreigners in town) were immediately noticeable. All eyes were on us, but not in an uncomfortable way; it was a gaze of curiosity, a warm, silent "welcome."
Everyone we met was incredibly polite, helpful, and full of smiles. It was here that I was once again struck by the many similarities between Turkish and Italian cultures. When I had a small problem, the person I asked for help didn't speak a word of English, but they literally did everything in their power to help me using body language, calling someone else, or walking me to my destination. That warmth, that genuine effort to help, made me feel completely at home.
I was able to form wonderful connections with people, regardless of their age. We joked with children playing in the street and greeted the elderly sitting at cafes. They engaged us in long, flowing conversations, curious about Turkey, our project, and our lives.

## Conclusion: A Second Project, Infinite Memories

This is my second Erasmus+ project, and just like the first, this experience has given me invaluable gifts. Taking responsibility as a group leader, living within a different culture, and forming heartfelt connections despite language barriers...
I am so happy to be in Poggiardo. This project has offered me not only professional experience but also the most authentic version of the Italian way of life.
If you are reading this and find yourself thinking, "I wonder..." I strongly urge you: You must come to Italy. And more importantly, no matter your age, join an Erasmus+ project. You will meet people who will change your life and collect memories you will never forget.
Arrivederci!
